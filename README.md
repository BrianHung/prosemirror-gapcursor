ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [plugin](http://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#gapcursor)
implements a block-level cursor that can be used to focus places that
don't allow regular selection (such as positions that have a leaf
block node, table, or the end of the document both before and after
them).

The [project page](http://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [examples](http://prosemirror.net/examples/) and the
[documentation](http://prosemirror.net/docs/).

**NOTE:** This project is in *BETA* stage. It isn't thoroughly tested,
and the API might still change across `0.x` releases. You are welcome
to use it, but don't expect it to be very stable yet.
